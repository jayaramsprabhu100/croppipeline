## Run the rainfall pipeline

Look at the NOAA FTP site to see if it has been updated, pull down data and write to table

```{r targets-rainfall}
targets::tar_make(names = tidyselect::starts_with('RF_'),
                  callr_arguments = list(env = c(month = params$month,
                                                 year = params$year)))
```

## Notes

This should be scheduled to run hourly from 10am-2pm and check if time on ftp server is updated

If the dbo.crop_auto_rainfall table is already up to date, publishing this document will fail but it will still be on the Connect Server.
