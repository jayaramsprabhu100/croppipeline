## Run the rainfall update pipeline

Update process looks at different FTP folder, if updated then overwrite rainfall table

```{r targets-rainfall-update}
targets::tar_make(names = tidyselect::starts_with('RFU_'),
                  callr_arguments = list(env = c(month = params$month,
                                                 year = params$year)))
```

## Notes

This should be scheduled to run once daily on the 12th-31st once a month, 2pm+ CDT

If the dbo.crop_auto_rainfall table is already up to date, publishing this document will fail but it will still be on the Connect Server.
