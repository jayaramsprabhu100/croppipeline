## Run the Summary of Business pipeline

Pull down summary of business data

```{r targets-SOB}
targets::tar_make(names = tidyselect::starts_with('SOB_'),
                  callr_arguments = list(env = c(year = params$year,
                                                 n_try = params$n_try,
                                                 timeout = params$timeout)))
```

## Notes

This should be run once daily but should early stop if data on database has been updated in the last 7 days.
